EDA
I'm writing the about the only Exploratory Data Analysis as I have not been studied the above modules. In EDA, I learnt about data souring, data cleaning and the key conepts were from the analysis section where I learnt different approach to analyze data like univariate and bivariate with respect to data types. Furthermore, I got to learn how to derive additinal matrics from the observation of existing metrics.
